# IDEAS

As the test says we could add some improvements to the UI/UX this file would serve as a brainstorming log.
Some of the ideas would be implemented, some don't, but having a record would help to futures improvements
that didn't make the cut due to the time limit.



## Styles

### Font

- [x] Search for Star Wars fonts, maybe one for titles and another for texts.

### Buttons and inputs

- [ ] Add some nice interaction animations, maybe something similar to a laser sable turning on when the user hover the button and inputs.

  - [x] Buttons
  - [ ] Inputs
  - [ ] Shadows animation

### Character page

- [ ] The values with colors, like hair, eyes, skin ... could use the color in the own text or in a background

### Scroll

- [ ] Some effect to the scroll would be nice. Maybe something similar to the SW films intro?.

### Background

- [ ] Stars background, maybe with blinking stars.

### Characters

- [ ] Add some images from the characters.



## Aditional features

### Error handling

- [ ] Some notification, maybe with an SW hologram style would be great,text can be something like "There were a perturbance in the force, please contact the jedi support administration"

### Scroll

- [ ] Add buttons "Scroll to top" and "Scroll to bottom"
- [ ] Scroll new elements to top when "Load more" button is pressed

### Filters and order

- [ ] Give the ability to order and filter the character list.

### Character page

- [ ] Maybe the user can input their mass and height and show some objects to compare with the character(Initially it can be a simple square, then it can be improved with silhouette)

### Main Page

- [ ] As the SWAPI have more items that just characters a landing page could be added with links to othersubsections, like characters, vehicles, films etc

### I18N

- [ ] Add a language selector in the main menu and i18n in all the components

### Theme selector

- [ ] Use css variables for colors and add a theme selector



## Other considerations

### Pagination

- [ ] If there is going to be a lot of character maybe the inclusion of a virtualization solution must be considered.
